# Hard_Hat_Detection_System
Hard Hat Detection System â€“ a specialized solution for situations where wearing a hard hat is a non-negotiable safety requirement. This project focuses on leveraging the YOLOv8 model, trained on a comprehensive dataset.
Our state-of-the-art Advanced Hard Hat Detection System goes beyond the conventional by not only detecting hard hat usage but also providing essential guidance during code execution within the Python environment. It offers comprehensive insights, including detecting the presence of helmets, vests, and masks, while also indicating the existence of a person within the frame for example: 1 NO-Hardhat, 1 NO-Mask, 1 NO-Safety Vest, 1 Person, 1322.1ms
